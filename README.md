# Automated Google Rank Tracking with Screenshot
This Python program uses Selenium WebDriver to parse search results from Google for a given list of search terms and compares the domain in the results to a list of domains. If a domain is found, a screenshot will be generated of the search results page and will be named search-phrase-position-found-domain-current-datetime.png i.e cosmetic-dentist-tigard-2-dentisttigard.com-20181005-130851.png This encludes if multiple domains are found for a search phrase, a screenshot will be generated for each domain.
